# XBT Bot Image Collection - Telegram Testing Instructions

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS**

The XBT bot's image collection has been successfully populated and is ready for testing. Follow these steps to validate the functionality through Telegram:

### **Step 1: Verify Image Collection Status**
1. Open your Telegram chat with the XBT bot
2. Send command: `/list_images`
3. **Expected Result:**
```
📁 Image Collection (4 images)

1. alert_image_1750647001.gif (1177.9 KB)
2. alert_image_1750647002.gif (1177.9 KB)  
3. alert_image_1750647003.jpg (45.8 KB)
4. alert_image_1750647005.jpg (45.8 KB)

🎲 Images are randomly selected for alerts
```

### **Step 2: Test Random Image Selection**
1. Send command: `/test` (admin only)
2. **Expected Result:** Bot will simulate an alert with a randomly selected image
3. **Repeat 3-5 times** to see different images being used
4. **Verify:** Different images appear across multiple test runs

### **Step 3: Test Image Upload Functionality**
1. Send command: `/setimage`
2. **Expected Response:** "Please send me the image you want to use for alerts"
3. **Upload a new image** (any PNG/JPG/JPEG/GIF)
4. **Expected Response:** "✅ Image uploaded successfully to collection"
5. **Verify:** Use `/list_images` to confirm the new image was added

### **Step 4: Validate Alert Integration**
1. **Monitor real alerts** (if trading volume is sufficient)
2. **OR trigger manual alerts** using `/test` command
3. **Verify:** Alerts use different images from the collection
4. **Check:** GIF files animate properly in Telegram
