# XBT Telegram Bot - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the enhancements and fixes made to the XBT Telegram Bot.

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### 1. `/setimage` Command Fix
**Problem**: Image upload functionality was broken due to conversation handler state conflicts.

**Root Cause**: Two conversation handlers were using the same `INPUT_IMAGE` state, causing the image upload handler to not trigger properly.

**Solution**:
- Added new conversation state: `INPUT_IMAGE_SETIMAGE = 6`
- Updated setimage conversation handler to use the new state
- Enhanced file type support (photos, documents, animations/GIFs)
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed default image fallback logic

**Testing**: ✅ All functionality verified working

### 2. Market Vibe Removal from `/price` Command
**Problem**: The `/price` command included subjective "Market Vibe" messages that could influence trading decisions.

**Solution**:
- Removed all sentiment-based messages (e.g., "🔥 FOMO MODE ACTIVATED!", "❄️ Crypto winter is here")
- Maintained professional, data-driven display
- Preserved all essential market data and momentum calculations

**Testing**: ✅ Verified Market Vibe section completely removed while maintaining data integrity
