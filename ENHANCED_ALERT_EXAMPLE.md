## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes Made

1. **Enhanced `send_alert()` function** in `telebot_fixed.py`:
   ```python
   # Add individual buy order details for aggregated alerts
   if trade_details and len(trade_details) > 1:
       message += f"\n📋 <b>Aggregated Buy Orders:</b>\n"
       
       # Display individual orders (up to 5)
       orders_to_show = min(5, len(trade_details))
       for i in range(orders_to_show):
           trade = trade_details[i]
           message += f"Order {i+1}: {trade['quantity']:.2f} XBT at {trade['price']:.6f} USDT\n"
       
       # If more than 5 orders, aggregate the remaining ones
       if len(trade_details) > 5:
           remaining_trades = trade_details[5:]
           remaining_quantity = sum(t['quantity'] for t in remaining_trades)
           remaining_count = len(remaining_trades)
           message += f"Orders 6-{len(trade_details)}: {remaining_quantity:.2f} XBT total ({remaining_count} additional orders)\n"
       
       # Add summary calculations
       message += f"\n📊 <b>Summary:</b>\n"
       message += f"Average Price: {price:.6f} USDT\n"
       message += f"Total Volume: {quantity:.2f} XBT\n"
       message += f"Total Value: {sum_value:.2f} USDT\n"
   ```

2. **Removed validation section** for cleaner messages:
   - Eliminated threshold ratio display
   - Removed buy volume confirmation
   - Streamlined message focus on trade details

3. **Preserved all existing features**:
   - Magnitude indicators (green squares)
   - Dynamic alert text based on transaction size
   - Real-time market prices
   - Volume data
   - Trading buttons and exchange links
